Customizing the Firefox UI with CSS
Firefox supports advanced customization of its UI with user-defined CSS. This allows virtually unlimited customization of the style of the browser, as well as some functionality customization.

You can define these rules in two files, userChrome.css and userContent.css.

userChrome.css affects the browser's chrome (a general term for a UI). This includes things like the address bar and tabs, as well as the menus (even the context menu).

userContent.css affects the browser's content, which are all Firefox-specific pages. This includes the new tab page (about:newtab), the options page (about:preferences), addons page (about:addons), and so on. You can see a complete list of about: pages at about:about.

Setup
1. Enable userChrome customisation in about:config
Navigate to about:config in the address bar and accept the risks.

Search for toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets and toggle it to true (by double clicking on it).

2. Locate and open your profile folder
Either of the following two methods work:

Using the Firefox troubleshooting page

Click on ☰ ➝ Help ➝ Troubleshooting Information or navigate to about:support in your address bar
Under Application Basics, click on the the Open Folder button. You should now see your profile folder.
Using the Firefox command line

Press Shift+F2
Enter the command folder openprofile
3. Create the folder and its files
Inside your profile folder, create a new folder named chrome (all lower case)

Inside the chrome folder, create two new files, userChrome.css and userContent.css (case sensitive)

Note: In Windows, you must disable the "Hide extensions for known file types" setting in Explorer. Once that's done, simply create a new text file (Right click ➝ New ➝ Text Document), then make sure to replace the .txt with .css
4. Populate the files
At the top of userChrome.css, add the following code. This tells the browser that this stylesheet is meant for XUL, the markup language Firefox is written in.
@namespace url("http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul");

That's it! Now that you've set everything up, all you need to do is add code to the files and restart the browser.

If you're writing the styles yourself, you can set up browser toolbox and edit the files directly in it, no restart required.
